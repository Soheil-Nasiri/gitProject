# This is a Header 1

My name is *Sohale Nasiri*. I repeat: _Sohale Nasiri_

I will **Bold** it if you want. Like __THIS__.

Or maybe you want ***Bold Italic*** at the same time.

No I will ~~NOT~~ accept it.

This is code though:

` print ("Hello World!")`

    Hello this is code block with just 4 spaces

```lua
print ("Hello World!")
```
